# Logistic Regression Analysis - Notebook Summary

## Created: logistic_regression_analysis.ipynb

### Structure:
- **52 cells total**
- **Cells 0-21**: Data loading and preprocessing
- **Cells 22-50**: All logistic regression analysis
- **Cell 0**: Title and introduction

### Contents:
1. **Imports and data loading** (Cells 1-2)
2. **Data preprocessing** (Cells 3-21):
   - Data merging
   - Feature encoding (one-hot, target encoding)
   - Train/test split
3. **Logistic Regression Models** (Cells 22-50):
   - Downsampled approach with resampling
   - Class-weighted approach with class_weight='balanced'
   - Hyperparameter tuning (C regularization)
   - Threshold optimization
   - ROC and Precision-Recall curves
   - Final model comparison

### Main notebook updated:
- **lasted-version 2.ipynb** now has 36 cells
- LR section replaced with reference to `logistic_regression_analysis.ipynb`
- Decision Tree and Random Forest sections remain intact

### Benefits:
- Cleaner main notebook focused on comparative analysis
- LR analysis is self-contained and reproducible
- Easier to present or share specific approaches
- Clearer separation of concerns
